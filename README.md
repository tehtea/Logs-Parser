# Logs-Parser
A simple program to extract messages containing '!play' from your discord logs.

To download your logs from a particular Discord server, use qwertyboy's logbot here: https://github.com/qwertyboy/logbot

Instructions:
1. Download the log you want using logbot
2. Make sure that the log is in the same working directory as the Logs Parser
3. Run the Logs Parser using Python 3
4. When prompted, key in the name of the log you downloaded, ensuring that you included the filetype at the end of the string you keyed in
5. The program will then prompt you for the name of the output file that you want. Include filetype at the end of the string you keyed in here too.
6. Your output file will appear in the current working directory! It should display all messages containing '!play'.

Enjoy and please give constructive feedback for me to improve :)
